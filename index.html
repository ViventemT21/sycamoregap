	<h1>Clue 6</h1>
	<p>Hola Amigo! Yes, I’m originally from Mexico. I belong to the Crassulaceae family. At first glance, I may appear as a mushroom. Overlapping, rounded triangles of one of my body parts form a Fibonacci spiral. I do not contain chlorophyll.  Although I have a waxy whitish colour, I can tend to be blue-grey when I grow in partial shade; in full, hot sun, grey-pink. I absorb nutrients through a unique process called myco-heterotrophy. Who am I? <br><br>
		<b>On finding the post, answer the following question:</b> <br>

	The key should be in lowercase and should not include any blank spaces, even if it contains multiple words.</p>
